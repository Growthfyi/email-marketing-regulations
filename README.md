# Email marketing regulations across the World.

As we live in an increasingly connected world other countries laws become relevant, even though we may not operate directly in them. Over the past year there have been significant changes to privacy regulations, most notably in Europe with the introduction of the GDPR. This document is created with the aim to keep email marketers informed on changes to regulations across the world so they can stay within the appropriate legislation.

## Key concepts/glossary

###### Explicit consent
Explicit consent gives the individual or business the right to deal with personal data. Consent can be acquired in written or oral form. Generally speaking you will need to keep a record of consent collection.

A typical example in email marketing is a website registration form, some legislation will ask that you provide customers with a check-box to consent to sign up for your newsletter.

- **Soft opt-in_**: When you have collected an email address as part of another process ,such as a purchase flow, but have given them a clear chance to opt out both when you first collected their details, and in every message you send. This is most commonly seen as a pre-checked check box during a purchase flow.
- **_Single opt-in_**: When the opt-in process has one step, so only a registration form is filled out. 
- **_Double opt-in_**: When the registration has to be confirmed via a link sent to the acquired email address.

###### Implied consent
Implied consent, also known as inferred consent, is usually derived from actions and circumstances, often a previous purchase or enquiry.

The best example is during online shopping. Imagine a customer has just bought a games console from your online store, you may assume that the client is interested in games and you may wish to contact them post-purchase with games which would be suitable for that system. If you have not specifically asked to contact this user (via a Checkbox or similar) this is called implied consent. 

The exact boundaries for both types of consents are defined in the specific country laws.
