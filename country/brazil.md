# Brazil
There is currently no legislation regulating the sending of spam. A legislation called Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) took effect in September 2020. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, delays to the effective date postponed the measure several times. Enforcement is not expected to begin until August 2021, when the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) is expected to be structured – the body will be responsible for regulating the law, preparing instructions for compliance with its rules and monitoring compliance. It is also not known until now what the budget of the ANPD will be – something that must be defined in the General Budget of the Union. Email marketers are advised to follow Brazil's Email Marketing Self-Regulation Code (CAPEM).

## Content required
None.

## Consent
Once LGPD is enforced, the sending of unsolicited communications must be done based on one of the two legal grounds for processing: consent, and controller's legitimate interest.

The LGPD is currently vague in defining what would constitute the controller's legitimate interest. Due to this, it is not recommended that businesses send emails based on legitimate interest grounds before the National Authority on Data Protection has ruled on what is compliant.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
The Email Marketing Self-Regulation Code (CAPEM) is a project undertaken by ISPs. The code is not legally binding and the ISPs only agree voluntarily to participate. It contains basic rules to protect internet users and asks marketers to include an opt-out link in every communication sent.

## Penalties
When LGPD is enforced, non-compliance will result in the following sanctions:
- Warning, with an indication of the period for adopting corrective measures.
- Simple fine of up to 2% of the revenue in Brazil of a private legal entity, group or conglomerate. The revenue is based on that for the prior financial year (excluding taxes) up to a total maximum of 50 million BRL per infraction.
- Daily fine, subject to the total maximum referred above.
