# Brazil
There is currently no legislation regulating the sending of spam. However, Brazil's long history of self-regulation in advertising issues has led to the creation of a Self-Regulation Code for E-mail Marketing Practices. In 2020 a new legislation, the LGPD, will come into force to regulate the industry further.

## Content required
None.

## Consent
Upon the LGPD’s introduction in 2020, the sending of unsolicited communications must be done based on one of the two legal grounds for processing: consent, and controller’s legitimate interest.

The LGPD is currently vague in defining what would constitute the controller’s legitimate interest. Due to this, it is not recommended that businesses send emails based on legitimate interest grounds before the National Authority on Data Protection has ruled on what is compliant.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
The Self-Regulation Code for Email Marketing Practices is a project undertaken by ISPs. The code is not legally binding and the ISPs only agree voluntarily to participate. It contains basic rules to protect internet users and asks marketers to include an opt-out link in every communication sent.

## Penalties
As of 15 August 2020, non-compliance with the LGPD will result in the following sanctions:
- Warning, with an indication of the period for adopting corrective measures.
- Simple fine of up to 2% of the revenue in Brazil of a private legal entity, group or conglomerate. The revenue is based on that for the prior financial year (excluding taxes) up to a total maximum of BRL50 million per infraction.
- Daily fine, subject to the total maximum referred above.
