# Japan
In Japan, unsolicited email communications are regulated by the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions (ASCT) and the Act on the Regulation of Transmission of Specified Electronic Mail (Anti-spam Act).

## Required content
Emails are required to include the sender's email address or website to facilitate the opt-out option.

## Consent
The ASCT requires email marketers to obtain consent from recipients before sending emails. Proof of consent must be kept for 3 years for email advertisements following the last email.

## Notable exceptions or requirements
There is no clear time period for which opt-out or unsubscribe requests must be honoured. However, the legislation does stipulate that no other emails can be sent once the recipient has opted out.

## Penalties
Japan imposes a fine of up to JPY 1,000,000 or 1 year imprisonment for violating email regulations.
