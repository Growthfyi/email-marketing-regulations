# USA
The USA has some of the least stringent regulations around Email Marketing. It is the CAN-SPAM ( Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) Act 2003 which applies.

## Content required
All emails must also include a valid postal address. The subject must also be reflective of the content and if you do not have prior consent it must be made clear that the message is commercial in nature. 

## Consent
CAN-SPAM, unlike most other pieces of email marketing legislation, works on an opt-out basis. There is no requirement for consent to contact subscribers based in the USA. You must make it clear how to opt-out and honor those requests promptly, within 10 business days

If sending email without prior consent, check with your email provider first. The majority of email service providers (such as MailChimp or EmailOctopus) require consent to contact your subscribers.
